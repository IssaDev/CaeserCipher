# Caeser Cipher
# Introduction
The Caeser cipher is one of the simplest and oldest encryption techniques, named after Julius Caesar who used it in his correspondence.
# Requirements
This project is intended to be run with blue J, if you do not have Blue J download, install and launch package.bluej
# Description
This program takes a text file that has been encrypted using the Caeser cipher, determines the two keys that were used to encrypt and then uses those keys to decrypt the message. Two text files have been provided as samples of encrypted text
# Usage
Launch package.bluej
Make a new instance of CaeserBreaker, right click Caeser and select `new CaeserBreaker()``
From the new instance created run void `testDecryptTwokeys()`
This opens the file explorer select `mysteryTwoKeysLong.txt` or `mysteryTwoKeysShort.txt`
The output shows the two keys that'll be used for decryption and the decrypted text
